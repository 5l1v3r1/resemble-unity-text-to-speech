## General info
Unity plugin to interface our API
	
## Setup
You can add Assets and Projects settings folders to your project or directly download the [latest build here](Output/ResemblePlugin_02-03-20.unitypackage).
  
  
  
#### Version
The plugin was created on version [2019.3.2](https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/whats-new/2019.2.8) of Unity. I recommend to have the same version in order to avoid any incompatibility problems.  
  
  
  
#### Instal package
The builds are present in the form of [Unitypackage](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html).  
To load a Unitypackage into your Unity project :
> Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
  
  
## Help
