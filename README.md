## General info
Unity plugin to interface our API
	
## Setup
You can add Assets and Projects settings folders to your project or directly download the [latest build here](Output/ResemblePlugin.unitypackage).
  
  
  
#### Version
The plugin was created on version [2019.3.2](https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/whats-new/2019.2.8) of Unity. I recommend to have the same version in order to avoid any incompatibility problems.  
  
  
  
#### Instal package
The builds are present in the form of [Unitypackage](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html).  
To load a Unitypackage into your Unity project :
> Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
  
  
## Help
You can find a documentation page about the plugin here :
>  Edit > Preferences... > Resemble > Help

### Try out sample scenes
The example scenes are not yet included in the plugin build. To test an example scene, you can download it directly from the repository.

There are currently two examples of the use of the phoneme table :

- ResembleExample_Shader.unity
- ResembleExample_Blendshapes.unity
