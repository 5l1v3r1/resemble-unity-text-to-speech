## General info
Unity plugin to interface our API
	
## Setup
  
You can add Assets and Projects settings folders to your project or directly download the [latest build here](Output/ResemblePlugin_19-02-20.unitypackage).
  
  
  
#### Version
The plugin was created on version 2019.8.2 of Unity. I recommend to have the same version in order to avoid any incompatibility problems.  
  
  
  
#### Instal package
The builds are present in the form of [https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html](Unitypackage).  
To load a Unitypackage into your project :
```
 - Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
 - Select the ResemblePlugin_xx-xx-xx.unitypackage file.
 - Import
```
