    userString: 'In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened,
      one stood.

      He chose the path of perpetual torment.

      In his ravenous
      hatred he found no peace.

      And with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral
      Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him.

      And
      those that tasted the bite of his sword named him.

      The Doom Slayer.'
